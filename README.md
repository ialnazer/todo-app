Enjoy adding tasks to your **Todo** list, mark them as completed, edit and delete them

The Todo list style is inspired by [Sawsan's Todo list UI](https://codepen.io/saawsan/pen/jayzeq)

This project is developed along with [Colt Steel's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp) - *Udemy*
